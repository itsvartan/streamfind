## How do you plan to use the TMDB API?

StreamFind uses the TMDB API to enhance movie search results with rich metadata including:

1. **Movie Details**: We retrieve comprehensive movie information including plot summaries, release dates, and runtime to provide users with complete movie details.

2. **Visual Assets**: We use TMDB's image API to display high-quality movie posters and backdrop images, creating an engaging visual experience for users browsing movies.

3. **Movie Metadata**: We fetch additional metadata such as cast information, genres, and ratings to help users make informed decisions about what to watch.

4. **Search Enhancement**: TMDB data supplements our primary streaming availability data from Watchmode API, ensuring users always see accurate and complete movie information.
